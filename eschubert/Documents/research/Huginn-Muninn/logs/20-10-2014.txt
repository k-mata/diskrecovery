Development replied back. They left a short message: CONTINUE MONITORING

This infuriates me to no end. This headache isn't helping too. I've been getting this migraine at the end of last week, but it's a kind I haven't experienced before. There's this really low thrum, like somebody threw a couple of subwoofers next to my face. I've raided the infirmary for pain medication - but now, it seems like a lot of other crew are experiencing the same symptoms. I swapped the First Mate a couple of pills for some cigarettes.

Meanwhile, the monitoring anomaly is getting worse. The radar black spot is getting a little bigger - and now it's occupying half of the image. It's practically useless for monitoring the air now. Talk about a 10 million-dollar paperweight.

First mate has not checked in into the bridge. Worrying.

Engineering reported an anomaly. Propellers were operating at sub-optimal conditions. They set out a couple of divers. They found half of the First Mate's body tangled in the prop. I didn't think of him as the type who would kill himself.

At least, the monitoring system appears to be picking up. I spotted two clear spots in the middle of the black zone. I hope it's better in the morning. Headaches are still bad though.
