Diary,

Dear god, the system is buggy. I'm trained to expect software failures every now and then - but this is insane. The system appears like it works, but it's rendering this huge black spot on top of the image. It's this circle that takes up a quarter of the screen, blurring softly at the edges until it can render heat again.
I'm gonna try to reposition the IR cameras to face the other way. Updates to come.

Diary,

Dammit, now the black spot isn't appearing when the cameras face toward the bow - which means it's probably an intermittent bug. I hate programmers.

I'm flipping it back to face the stern.

The black spot is back. This is absurd. If the reading is correct, then that means that there's a cold mass approximately 10 kilometres in radius floating in the sky.

I think it's time I reported this to development.
