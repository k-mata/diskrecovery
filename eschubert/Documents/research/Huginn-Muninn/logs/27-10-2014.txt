The headaches are getting worse. The thrum is still there, but it seems to have lost it's pattern. It's not the kind of thrum you could sleep to - the irregularity keeps you awake at night. Most of the crew are experiencing the same thing. We've had a couple of fights over the weekend.

Morale is at an all-time low. Worse, the outer radar black spots are getting bigger. It's now at three-quarters of the screen. I've given up on fixing it. I don't have the mental strength to, considering these headaches.

First and second engineers are missing. Propellers are dead. Comms array is down.

I hope somebody finds us.
